      <h2>The Central Problem</h2>
      <p>When does a scholar-official leave public life? The four texts in this section offer four different answers—and four different relationships to the philosophical traditions (Confucian and Daoist) that frame the question. Each text also reveals that "seclusion" is never just personal: it's always a statement about the state, about power, and about what counts as a good life.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="meta">Yang Yün 楊惲 · Western Han · pp. 159–161 · Translated by Burton Watson</div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Situation</h3>
        <p>Yang Yün was the grandson of the historian Ssu-ma Ch'ien. He rose to high office under Emperor Hsüan (74–48 BCE), was enfeoffed as a marquis, then fell—accused of "treasonable acts and utterances." The emperor spared his life but stripped him of rank. Yang retired to the countryside to farm. His friend Sun Hui-tsung wrote to criticize him: a disgraced gentleman should live in "humble and abject seclusion," not throw parties and speculate in grain. This letter is Yang's reply.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Philosophical Stakes</h3>
        <span class="philosophy-tag confucian">Confucian</span>
        <span class="philosophy-tag political">Political Ethics</span>
        <p>Yang Yün's defense rests on a distinction he draws from the Han Confucian thinker <strong>Tung Chung-shu</strong>:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"To strive with all one's might for benevolence and righteousness, fearful always lest one fail to educate the people—this is the ambition of a statesman. To strive with all one's might for goods and profit, fearful always of poverty and want—this is the business of ordinary people."</p>
          <cite>— p. 161</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Yang's argument: since Sun is a statesman pursuing benevolence, and Yang is now an ordinary person pursuing livelihood, they follow different roads. He cites <strong>Confucius</strong>: "those who do not follow the same road cannot lay plans for each other" (Analerta 15.40).</p>
        <p>This is a <em>Confucian</em> defense of withdrawal—not a rejection of Confucian values, but an argument that those values no longer apply to him. He's not a sage in hiding; he's a commoner now, and commoners are allowed to enjoy life.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Life He Defends</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"My family and I work hard in our fields, and when the summer and winter holidays come, we boil a sheep, roast a young lamb, bring out a measure of wine and rest from our labors."</p>
          <cite>— p. 160</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>He describes making music with his wife (she plays the lute; he sings in the Ch'in style), drinking until his ears burn, then thumping a crock and singing:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I sowed the southern hill / But I could not keep back the weeds. / I planted an acre of beans / But they fell off the vine, leaving bare stems. / Man's life should be spent in joy; / Why wait in vain for wealth and honor?"</p>
          <cite>— p. 160</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This song echoes Daoist and folk traditions of "enjoying the moment," but Yang frames it as the natural result of his changed status, not as philosophical Daoism.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Key Tension</h3>
        <p>Yang admits to grain speculation—buying cheap, selling dear for 10% profit—and calls it "a vile and merchantly thing." He's not claiming moral purity. He's claiming that <em>Sun's standards don't apply</em>. The letter's tone mixes self-deprecation with defiance: he knows he's diminished, but he refuses to perform shame.</p>

      <div class="meta">Hsi K'ang 嵇康 · Wei-Jin · pp. 162–166 · Translated by J.R. Hightower</div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Situation</h3>
        <p>Hsi K'ang (223–262 CE) was one of the <strong>Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove</strong>—a group of scholars who gathered to drink, discuss philosophy, and reject the corrupt politics of the Ssu-ma family's rise to power. His friend Shan T'ao was leaving a government post and recommended Hsi K'ang as his replacement. This letter is Hsi K'ang's refusal—so thorough that it ends their friendship. (Hsi K'ang was later executed, partly for his nonconformity.)</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>Philosophical Stakes</h3>
        <span class="philosophy-tag daoist">Daoist</span>
        <span class="philosophy-tag confucian">Anti-Confucian</span>
        <p>Unlike Yang Yün, Hsi K'ang explicitly rejects the Confucian framework. He names his masters:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Lao Tzu and Chuang Chou are my masters: they held mean positions. I would hardly criticize them. And Confucius, out of his love for all, was ready to hold a coachman's whip."</p>
          <cite>— p. 162</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Note the backhanded treatment of Confucius: he's praised only for willingness to take a lowly job—not for his teachings on governance. Hsi K'ang then attacks the Confucian culture heroes directly:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"I am always finding fault with T'ang and Wu Wang, or running down the Duke of Chou and Confucius. If I did not stop this in society, it is clear that the religion of the times would not put up with me."</p>
          <cite>— p. 165</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>T'ang and Wu Wang are the founders of the Shang and Zhou dynasties—figures Confucians treat as sage-kings. Hsi K'ang's attack on them was politically charged: the Ssu-ma family was about to overthrow the Wei in exactly the way T'ang and Wu overthrew their predecessors. Praising such "virtuous usurpers" was regime propaganda; criticizing them was dissent.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Seven Things He Cannot Stand</h3>
        <p>Hsi K'ang lists seven aspects of official life incompatible with his nature:</p>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Lying late abed</strong> while heralds wait at his door</li>
          <li><strong>Walking and singing freely</strong> while surrounded by subordinates who would restrict his movement</li>
          <li><strong>Bowing and kowtowing in formal clothes</strong> while infested with lice (he says he goes half a month without washing)</li>
          <li><strong>Writing letters and handling business</strong>—he's never been a good calligrapher and hates paperwork</li>
          <li><strong>Attending funerals</strong>—"things people consider important" that he cannot endure</li>
          <li><strong>Serving with vulgar people</strong> whose "clamor deafens the ears" and "double-dealings" revolt him</li>
          <li><strong>Having his mind bound</strong> with a thousand worldly cares</li>
        </ol>
        <p>This list mixes the physical (lice, sleepiness) with the philosophical (hatred of hypocrisy). The mixing is deliberate: Hsi K'ang's Daoism is about <em>natural spontaneity</em>, and his bodily habits are as much "his nature" as his ideas.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3>The Wild Deer</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"In this I am like the wild deer, which captured young and reared in captivity will be docile and obedient. But if it be caught when full-grown, it will stare wildly and butt against its bonds, dashing into boiling water or fire to escape. You may dress it up with a golden bridle and feed it delicacies, and it will but long the more for its native woods and yearn for rich pasture."</p>
          <cite>— p. 163</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>This is the letter's central image. Hsi K'ang says he was "spoiled" as a child—never disciplined into Confucian ritual behavior—so his nature is now untameable. Office would be a cage; he would destroy himself trying to escape.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3">The Daoist Alternative</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Of late I have been studying the techniques of prolonging one's life, casting out all ideas of fame and glory, eliminating tastes, and letting my mind wander in stillness: what is most worthwhile to me is Inaction."</p>
          <cite>— p. 165</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p><strong>Inaction</strong> (wu-wei 無為) is the Daoist term for acting in accordance with natural spontaneity rather than forcing outcomes. Hsi K'ang's retirement isn't just personal preference—it's a philosophical program drawn from the <em>Laozi</em> and <em>Zhuangzi</em>.</p>

        <h3>The Story</h3>
        <p>During the T'ai-yüan reign period (376–396 CE), a fisherman from Wu-ling follows a stream and loses track of distance. He comes upon a grove of blossoming peach trees, follows the stream to its source, and finds a narrow cave. Passing through, he emerges into a hidden valley: fertile fields, pleasant ponds, mulberry and willow, paths linking farms, people working contentedly.</p>
        <p>The villagers explain: their ancestors fled here during the Ch'in dynasty (221–206 BCE) to escape the turmoil. They've been cut off ever since. They don't even know the Han dynasty existed, let alone the Wei or Chin.</p>
        <p>The fisherman stays several days, then leaves. Despite marking his route, he can never find the place again. A learned hermit seeks it and fails. "Since that time there have been no further 'seekers of the ford.'"</p>
      </div>

        <span class="philosophy-tag daoist">Daoist Primitivism</span>
        <span class="philosophy-tag confucian">Confucian Allusion</span>
        <p>The Peach Blossom Spring draws on <strong>Daoist primitivism</strong>—the idea (from <em>Laozi</em> ch. 80) of small self-sufficient communities where people "find their food sweet, their clothing beautiful, their homes comfortable, their customs delightful" and never travel to neighboring villages.</p>
        <p>But the story also engages <strong>Confucian</strong> tradition. The phrase "seekers of the ford" (問津者) alludes to <em>Analerta</em> 18.6, where Confucius sends a disciple to ask recluses for directions to a river crossing. The recluses mock Confucius for trying to reform a disordered world. T'ao Ch'ien's ending—"no further seekers of the ford"—suggests that the search for utopia has been abandoned.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3">Why It Can't Be Found Again</h3>
        <p>The fisherman tells the prefect, who sends officers. They fail. A hermit tries. He dies. The story insists that the place is <em>real</em>—the fisherman stayed there, ate their food—but <em>unreachable</em>.</p>
        <p>One reading: utopia is destroyed by being reported to authorities. The fisherman's betrayal (he was told "Do not speak of us to the people outside") makes return impossible.</p>
        <p>Another reading: perfect withdrawal can only exist in imagination. The moment you try to find it deliberately, it disappears. This matches the Daoist paradox that seeking the Way (Tao) through effort defeats the purpose.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3">The Political Edge</h3>
        <p>The villagers fled the Ch'in—the dynasty famous for tyranny, book-burning, and forced labor. T'ao Ch'ien wrote during the Eastern Jin, a period of weak central government, warlord conflict, and northern invasion. The fantasy of a community that escaped all dynastic history entirely is pointed: it imagines life without the state.</p>

        <h3">The Situation</h3>
        <p>This is a satirical piece in ornate parallel prose. The conceit: the spirits of Bell Mountain issue a proclamation denouncing a certain Chou Yung, who posed as a recluse—studying Daoist and Buddhist texts, living in a hermitage called "Grass Hut"—but immediately accepted office when the court summoned him. The mountains themselves bar him from returning.</p>

        <span class="philosophy-tag political">Authentic vs. Fake</span>
        <span class="philosophy-tag confucian">Reclusion as Career</span>
        <p>By the fifth century, "reclusion" had become a recognized path to fame. Emperors sought out famous hermits to demonstrate their virtue; being summoned from retirement was prestigious. K'ung Chih-kuei's satire attacks this system:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"At the present time there is Chou Tzu, / An outstanding man among the vulgar, / Cultured and a scholar, / Philosopher and scribe. / But he needs must / Imitate Yen Ho's retirement, / Copy Nan-kuo's meditation, / Occupy the Grass Hut by imposture, / Usurp a hermit's cap on North Mountain..."</p>
          <cite>— p. 170</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The names (Yen Ho, Nan-kuo) are genuine recluses from the <em>Zhuangzi</em> and <em>Liezi</em>. Chou Yung is accused of <em>imitating</em> them—performing reclusion without the inner commitment.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <h3">The Mountain's Verdict</h3>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"He burned his castalian garments and tore his lotus clothes / He raised a wordly face and carried on in a vulgar manner. / Wind-driven clouds grieved as they carried their anger / Rock-rimmed springs sobbed as they trickled their disappointment / Forests and crags appeared to lack something / Grass and trees seemed to have suffered loss."</p>

        <h3">What This Reveals</h3>
        <p>The satire works only because readers share certain assumptions:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There <em>is</em> such a thing as authentic reclusion (the genuine sages invoked throughout)</li>
          <li>Withdrawal should be motivated by inner conviction, not career strategy</li>
          <li>The tension between reclusion and office is a <em>real</em> dilemma, not a pose</li>
        </ul>
        <p>K'ung Chih-kuei isn't attacking reclusion itself—he's defending it against those who would cheapen it. The piece assumes the Hsi K'ang position (reclusion as authentic Daoist practice) and attacks those who fake it.</p>

      <h2>Discussion Questions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Yang Yün claims he's now an "ordinary person," not a statesman.</strong> Is this a genuine philosophical position or a rhetorical dodge? Can you simply opt out of the Confucian framework?</li>
        <li><strong>Hsi K'ang lists bodily discomforts (lice, kneeling) alongside philosophical objections.</strong> Why mix them? What does this say about his understanding of "nature" (hsing 性)?</li>
        <li><strong>The Peach Blossom Spring can never be found again.</strong> Is this because the fisherman betrayed the villagers, because utopia is inherently unreachable, or something else?</li>
        <li><strong>K'ung Chih-kuei's satire depends on distinguishing "real" from "fake" recluses.</strong> What are the criteria? How would you tell the difference?</li>
        <li><strong>All four texts assume withdrawal requires justification.</strong> Why? What does this reveal about the default expectations for educated men in early medieval China?</li>
